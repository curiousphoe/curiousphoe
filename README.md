- 👋 Hi, I’m Phoenix @curiousphoe
- 👀 I’m interested in gardening, boxing, science, and learning new knowledge.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code with Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing.
- 📫 How to reach me? I am new to Github and the system, I wonder is there any way you can drop me a message or email in Github,
